**ðŸ“Š Paisabazaar Banking Fraud Analysis | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project**

I performed a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a real-world banking dataset from Paisabazaar to detect patterns and anomalies related to fraudulent financial transactions. This analysis aims to assist financial institutions in identifying risk factors and enhancing fraud detection mechanisms through data-driven insights.

**ðŸ’¡ Key Insights Uncovered:**

Fraudulent Patterns: Identified key behavioral traits and transaction anomalies commonly associated with fraud cases.

Transaction Trends: Analyzed transaction volumes, frequency, and amounts across customer segments.

Risk Segmentation: Segregated customer and transaction profiles based on risk factors like transaction type, location, and timing.

Amount vs. Fraud Probability: Explored relationships between transaction amount and likelihood of fraud.

Time-Based Analysis: Detected suspicious activity patterns based on time of day, day of the week, and frequency.

**ðŸ”§ Tools & Techniques Used:**

Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data manipulation and visual exploration.

Data Cleaning: Handled null values, removed duplicates, and treated outliers to prepare a robust dataset.

Statistical Analysis: Used correlation analysis and distribution plots to identify fraud indicators.

Visualization: Developed meaningful visual dashboards and charts to highlight trends and red flags.

**ðŸŒŸ Impact:**
This project demonstrates how EDA can play a crucial role in financial fraud detection by uncovering suspicious behaviors early. The insights gained can be used to strengthen security measures, reduce fraudulent losses, and build trust in digital financial platforms.
